## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

### Potential Blockers
- **Safari Limitations**: iOS Safari doesn't support web push
  - **Mitigation**: Document limitation, focus on Android/Desktop
- **FCM Quota Limits**: Firebase has daily/monthly limits
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor usage, implement batching
- **Permission Denial**: Users may deny notification permission
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, re-request flow

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Safari compatibility | High | Medium | Document limitation |
| FCM quota exceeded | Low | High | Monitor + alerting |
| User adoption low | Medium | Medium | Improved onboarding |
| Performance impact | Low | High | Thorough testing |

## 🌟 Cloudflare Workers Benefits

### Why Cloudflare Workers + KV?

**Cost Effectiveness:**
- **$0/month** for up to 100k requests/day (3M/month)
- **10GB free KV storage** (can store 100k+ subscriptions)
- No cold starts or idle timeouts
- Global edge performance (<50ms latency)

**Technical Advantages:**
- **No Firebase dependency** for push notifications
- **Web Push API** standard compliance
- **Global distribution** via Cloudflare's edge network
- **Instant deployments** with Git integration
- **Built-in DDoS protection** and security

**Implementation Benefits:**
- **Simple architecture** - just HTTP endpoints
- **Easy testing** with local development server
- **Standard web technologies** (no vendor lock-in)
- **Scalable by default** - handles traffic spikes automatically

### Migration from Firebase Cloud Functions
The Cloudflare Workers approach is **simpler and more cost-effective** than Firebase Cloud Functions:

| Aspect | Cloudflare Workers | Firebase Functions |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | Free (100k req/day) | $0.40/million after 2M |
| **Cold Starts** | None (always warm) | 1-3 seconds |
| **Global Performance** | <50ms (edge locations) | Variable (regions) |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Minimal (standard APIs) | High (Firebase specific) |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple (wrangler deploy) | Complex (Firebase project) |

This task tracking document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the PWA push notification implementation using Cloudflare Workers with clear timelines, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.
